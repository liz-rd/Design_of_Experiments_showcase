# Design_of_Experiments_showcase
This showcase details a start to finish experiment designed and conducted by me using good experimental design practices.
It also shows good data integrety practices, both in data collection and in the data analysis areas. 

It was originally for a project for one of my Master in Data Science and Analytics classes where the goal was to collect, record, analyize and draw conclusions from an original experiment. 
There was emphasis on sound practices and solid data integrity. 
The analysis and visualizations were conducted using minitab.

The experiment itself was following two different factors when baking cookies; dough chill time and fat content.
Which resulted in cookies with 3 possible bake times and two different fat contents in the final results, which is tracked by the width of each cookie.
